# C subset compiler

This repository contains a resurected version of Lennart Augustsson compiler for a small subset of C.

The compiler is sufficiantly advaced that it is able to compile itself.

My goal resurecting this project is to clean up and document the code to make it a good learning vehicle.

# Original Readme

This is an implementation of a small subset of C.

Do `make test' to compile and test everything.

parse.c contains a compiler that emits byte code for
the C code it reads on stdin.

interp.c contains the interpreter for the byte code.

parse.c is written in the same subset of C that it can
compile.  interp.c is not, but with some minimal tweaking
it can be.
